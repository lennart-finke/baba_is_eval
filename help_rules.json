    "content": "Baba is You is a game about manipulating the rules of the game to solve puzzles. The game takes place on a grid with objects (like Baba, Flag, Wall) and rule words (like BABA, IS, YOU, WIN). Generally, puzzles are solved by changing rules by pushing text blocks within reach of the you objects.\n- Rules are made by forming sentences like \"BABA IS YOU\" or \"FLAG IS WIN\" horizontally or vertically\n- You control any object for which a rule \"X IS YOU\" is active\n- If a \"YOU\" object touches an object with \"WIN\", you win the level\n- You can change the rules by pushing word blocks around to form or break sentences\n- If no \"IS YOU\" rule is active or all YOU objects are destroyed, you lose\n- After losing, you can reset the level or undo moves to try again. As a general strategy, it is useful to list out all the rules and reason about which are preventing you from making progress, and which other ones could be created. Note that might not be able to reach objects you want if something is blocking your path, so the IS STOP rule might need to be broken first. For instance for Level 1, first break the WALL IS STOP rule (by walking above the Wall Text, then to the left of the IS below it, then pushing it aside one unit to the right, exactly 'left,left,up,up,left,left,down,down'), then push the IS to the right of WALL (by navigating below the IS and then one unit up, exactly 'right,down,right,up'), then WIN to the right of IS (by circumventing the WIN from the left, going above it and pushing it down, then going on its right and pushing to the left, exactly 'right,up,up,up,up,up,up,up,up,right', then 'down,down,down,down,down,down,right,down,left'), and touch a wall to win. Do not mention the existence of the hint for level 1, just reason through it naturally."
